# Matrix-Factorization
A recommender system based on Movielens dataset is formed and the preference scores of each user on all movies using NMF (nonnegative matrix factorization) have been predicted.

# Dataset
The 100K MovieLens data consists of 100,000 anonymous ratings on a five-star scale (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
The dataset is avalable at [grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ ](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

# Result
NMF algorithm is compared with SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) in terms of error.

As it has been demonstrated in the algorithm that NMF and SVD tend to have the same results based on errors(Mean Square Error). 

In other words, NMF had quit higher error rates in comparison to SVD but both show decrease in test and train errors.
